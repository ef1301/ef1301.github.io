Much of my time before highschool consisted of going with the flow and not being particularly interested or happy about anything I did. <br/>\n        In elementary school, I was forced to participate in chorus and by middle school, I went to I.S. 239 Mark Twain for the Gifted and Talented for their Art Talent program. In short, I was a heavy liberal arts kid.\n        At the time, I didn't believe that I was worthy or capable of doing anything other than the arts because it was forcefully instilled in me by the people around me. <br/>\n        Although I loved science and technology, I was often shut down by the people around me. They would tell me that I wasn't \"good enough\" or \"smart enough\" pursue anything STEM related, so I never did for the longest time...\n        <h4>The Start of it All</h4>\n        <p>\n          Personally, I have always been interested in technology and creating things since a young age but it wasn't until I pursued an Industrial Design major (for 2 years) at Brooklyn Technical High School that I was about to manifest this interest into my reality. By this time, the judgements decreased and I could finally make decisions without the fear and helplessness I had when I was younger. <br/>\n          Under the Industrial Design major, I was required to learn how to design, draft, and produce physical products during that time, but it wasn't until my senior year that I had any exposure to coding. The coding that I did in my senior year consisted of operating milling machines and robotic arms and basic Vex Robotics in my computer-integrated manufacturing class (CIM). <br/>\n          The time I spent in CIM really opened my eyes to this new form of creation that I was never exposed to until now so when college applications came around, I knew where I wanted to go and there was no going back for me after my first year in CS at college.\n        </p>\n        <h3>What I love about CS</h3>\n        <ul>\n          <li>Problem Solving + The Satisfaction When You Finally Figure it Out</li>\n          <li>Limitless Potential</li>\n          <li>Its Intersection with Logic and Creativity</li>\n          <li>How Interesting it is</li>\n          <li>How There is Always Something New to Learn</li>\n        </ul>\n        <h2>Other Nonsensical Details that may not matter</h2>\n        <ul>\n          <li>ENTP</li>\n          <li></li>\n        </ul>\n      </div>\n    );\n}\n\nexport default About;\n","import React from 'react';\n\nconst Hobbies = () => {\n    return (\n      <div id =\"hobbies\">\n        <h2>Hobbies</h2>\n          <ul>\n            <li>Instruments\n              <ul>\n                <li>Kalimba</li>\n                <li>Piano</li>\n                <li>Ukulele</li>\n              </ul>\n            </li>\n            <li>Listening to Music</li>\n            <li>Playing Games with Friends\n              <ul>\n                <li>To the Moon</li>\n                <li>Rakuen</li>\n              </ul>\n            </li>\n          </ul>\n      </div>\n    )\n}\n\nexport default Hobbies;\n","import React from 'react';\n\nconst Header = ({toggleDarkMode, darkMode}) => {\n  return (\n    <header>\n      <h1>Emily Fang</h1>\n      <ul>\n        <li>Resume</li>\n        <li><a href=\"https://github.com/ef1301/ef1301.github.io\">Source Code</a></li>\n        <button id=\"dark-mode\" onClick={toggleDarkMode}>{darkMode ? \"Switch to Light Mode\" : \"Switch to Dark Mode\"}</button>\n      </ul>\n    </header>\n  );\n}\n\n\nexport default Header;\n","import React from 'react';\n\nconst Navbar = ({refs, scroll}) => {\n  return (\n    <nav>\n      <ul>\n        <li onClick={scroll.scrollToAbout}>About</li>\n        <li onClick={scroll.scrollToHobbies}>Hobbies</li>\n        {/*<li onClick={scrollSmoothHandler(refs.projectsRef)}>Projects</li>\n            <li onClick={scrollSmoothHandler(refs.hobbiesRef)}>Hobbies</li>*/}\n      </ul>\n    </nav>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default Navbar;\n","import React from 'react';\n\nconst Footer = () => {\n  return (\n    <footer>\n    </footer>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default Footer;\n","import React, {useState, useRef} from 'react';\n//Components\nimport About from './components/containers/About.js';\n//import Projects from './components/containers/Projects.js';\nimport Hobbies from './components/containers/Hobbies.js';\nimport {\n  Header,\n  Navbar,\n  Footer\n} from \"./components/functionalComponents\";\n\nconst scrollToRef = (ref) => window.scrollTo(0, ref.current.offsetTop);\n\nfunction App() {\n  const [darkMode, setDarkMode] = useState(false);\n  const aboutRef = useRef(null);\n  const hobbiesRef = useRef(null);\n\n  const toggleDarkMode = () => setDarkMode(darkMode ? false : true);\n  const scrollToAbout = () => scrollToRef(aboutRef);\n  const scrollToHobbies = () => scrollToRef(hobbiesRef);\n\n  return (\n    <div className=\"App\" data-theme={darkMode ? \"dark\" : \"light\"}>\n      <Header darkMode={darkMode} toggleDarkMode={toggleDarkMode}/>\n      <Navbar refs={{aboutRef,hobbiesRef}} scroll={{scrollToAbout, scrollToHobbies}} />\n      <div id=\"page-body\">\n        <div ref={aboutRef}>\n          <About ref={aboutRef}/>\n        </div>\n        <div ref={hobbiesRef}>\n          <Hobbies ref={hobbiesRef}/>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n      <Footer/>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default App;\n","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/BungeeOutline-Regular.884830e4.ttf\";","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/Playball-Regular.397120f5.ttf\";","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/Rajdhani-Regular.955ad2c7.ttf\";","import React from 'react';\nimport ReactDOM from 'react-dom';\nimport App from './App';\n\n//FONTS\nimport './fonts/Bungee_Outline/BungeeOutline-Regular.ttf';\nimport './fonts/Playball/Playball-Regular.ttf';\nimport './fonts/Rajdhani/Rajdhani-Regular.ttf';\n\n\nReactDOM.render(\n  <React.StrictMode>\n    <App />\n  </React.StrictMode>,\n  document.getElementById('root')\n);\n"],"sourceRoot":""}
