        <h3>Why I chose CS</h3>
        <section>
          <h4>My Life Before</h4>
          Growing up, I was always "that one art kid." I was always very quiet
          and kept to myself. Much of my time before highschool consisted of
          going with the flow and not being particularly interested or happy
          about anything I did. <br />
          In elementary school, I was forced to participate in chorus and by
          middle school, I went to I.S. 239 Mark Twain for the Gifted and
          Talented for their Art Talent program. In short, I was a heavy liberal
          arts kid. At the time, I didn't believe that I was worthy or capable
          of doing anything other than the arts because it was forcefully
          instilled in me by the people around me. <br />
          Although I loved science and technology, I was often shut down by the
          people around me. They would tell me that I wasn't "good enough" or
          "smart enough" pursue anything STEM related, so I never did for the
          longest time...

          <h4>The Start of it All</h4>
          <p>
            Personally, I have always been interested in technology and creating
            things since a young age but it wasn't until I pursued an Industrial
            Design major (for 2 years) at Brooklyn Technical High School that I
            was about to manifest this interest into my reality. By this time,
            the judgements decreased and I could finally make decisions without
            the fear and helplessness I had when I was younger. <br />
            Under the Industrial Design major, I was required to learn how to
            design, draft, and produce physical products during that time, but
            it wasn't until my senior year that I had any exposure to coding.
            The coding that I did in my senior year consisted of operating
            milling machines and robotic arms and basic Vex Robotics in my
            computer-integrated manufacturing class (CIM). <br />
            The time I spent in CIM really opened my eyes to this new form of
            creation that I was never exposed to until now so when college
            applications came around, I knew where I wanted to go and there was
            no going back for me after my first year in CS at college.
